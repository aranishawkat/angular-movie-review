          "Took my son to see this this afternoon. Could not have been a better experience. Our son is autistic so we weren't sure how he'd react sitting still for so long... He sat, for the entirety of the movie! He clapped, he got excited in certain parts but most importantly he sat still eating his popcorn from beginning to end!! ðŸ˜€ very, very proud parents here. I love all things cinema, film and TV so this means so much to me.",
